            <b> ⭑ Experience Level: </b> I would say I am familiar with HTML/CSS & JavaScript. I am definitely more comfortable with HTML/CSS than JS but am actively
            trying to learn more through free online resources, and hope to learn lots in this class.

            <b> ⭑ Lab 1 Blog Entry </b> In this lab I used advanced CSS techniques to format and design my pages. I used positioning techniques like floating and absloute position
            to create the layout I wanted. I also used CSS to change the fonts, colors, link styles, and other aesthetics to my liking. I really enjoyed this lab, it was really fun being able to design
            a web page and was very satisfying when I finally got it to look the way I envisioned. I had some trouble with positioning my footer correctly, if there is too much text on the page.
            That was my main struggle during this lab.

            <b> ⭑ Lab 2 Blog Entry </b> This lab focused on creating virtual pages in one HTML document with a responsive design, as well as changing Lab1 to make it have a responsive design. I liked this lab because I think it
            is important to learn how to make webpages responsive, every webpage should be responsive, since they are not only being viewed on desktops but also tablets and phones.
            I think I learned a lot from this lab since I didn't know how to use media queries before this lab. I struggled with making the form send info to my email, for some reason I kept getting errors with that portion and I couldn't seem to figure it out.
            I had to do a lot of trouble-shooting and testing to make my pages fully responsive and kept getting different styling issues that were not obvious to figure out at first. I used the browser debugger
            and that helped me a lot to see what was doing what.

            <b> ⭑ Lab 3 Blog Entry </b> In this lab we created a dating website, using HTML,CSS and Javascript. We used Javascript to work with the DOM and modify the page dynamically.
            I really enjoyed this lab because it was interesting and I believe, a great practice of what we have learned so far with JavaScript. This lab really helped my knowledge of arrays and objects,
            and really how everything works.And, I loved being able to make the page interactive! My struggles with this lab were, making sure I was putting functions and code in the right scope, in order
            for it to work properly. I got alot of problems I had to spend a lot of time figuring out, like putting my event handlers in the correct spot so they would fire correctly.

            <b> ⭑ Lab 4 Blog Entry </b> This lab was super super helpful and awesome, yet super super time consuming. I spent hours upon hours working on this lab, just solving small errors I would get throughout the proccess.
            At one point, I was stuck for about 2-3 hours trying to figure out why every time I would regiester a new person, it would overwrite the old person. I started panic coding and trying to do things in a super complicated way like concatnating
            multiple arrays ect. However, I took a step back and found a two line solution. That is kind of the story of how this entire lab went for me, after a while things would finally 'click' for me. I spent the least amount of time working
            on the 'Liked' and 'Passed' page functions, because once I got the hang of things those came to me very quickly. This lab helped me learn how local storage works, extremely well. I also feel SUPER comfortable about JQuery because of this lab.
            My code is unfortunately not cleaned up, I did not get a chance to do that, however I think overall this lab made me feel more confident in my programming/problem solving skills. One thing that I felt good about was that I noticed 
            I wasn't trying to solve problems using 'trial&error', which is my usual go to. I was actually thinking through logic and drawing out what was happening before writing functions, so I completley understood why and how everything works. 
            This lab, for me, was alot of work, but I am so glad it was assigned because I feel way more confident with javascript, jquery, and how to approach problems in general.
