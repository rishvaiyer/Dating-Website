        <h1> INTRO </h1>
        This is a website I have created for my CIS 3344 class. You can use the links
        at the top of the page in the navigation bar to navigate through the site.

        In this class we will be learning the principles of client/server interaction. We will become proficent in HTML/CSS to design a user-interface
        for web applications. We will learn responsive web design, JavaScript, object-oriented programming,
        Ajax, jQuery, JSON and XML. This information was taken from the class syllabus.
